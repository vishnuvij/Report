Phylogenetic profiles are representations of the presence or absence of specific genes or proteins across a set of related organisms. Each organism's genome is examined, and a binary pattern is created for each gene or protein, indicating whether it is present or absent in that organism. These binary profiles are then compared across multiple organisms to identify patterns of gene presence or absence that can reveal functional relationships and evolutionary history. Phylogenetic profiling is the analysis of these phylogenetic profiles to infer functional relationships between genes or proteins. The basic idea is that genes or proteins that have similar profiles—meaning they tend to be present or absent in the same set of organisms—are likely to be functionally related or involved in the same biological pathways.

In the context of genetic relationships, homologs refer to genes that share a common ancestral origin. Orthologs specifically denote genes that originated from a single ancestral gene found in the last common ancestor of the compared genomes. Pseudo orthologs, on the other hand, are genes that are actually paralogs, meaning they resulted from gene duplications, but they appear to be orthologous due to selective gene loss in specific lineages. Xenologs represent homologous genes acquired by one or both of the compared species through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), yet they appear orthologous when comparing the genomes pairwise. Co-orthologs refer to two or more genes in one lineage that are collectively orthologous to one or more genes in another lineage due to lineage-specific duplications. These genes are considered inparalogs relative to the respective speciation event.

Conversely, paralogs are genes related through duplication events within a genome. Inparalogs, also known as symparalogs, result from lineage-specific duplications that occurred after a given speciation event, with their classification being relative to that specific speciation event. Out paralogs, or alloparalogs, are paralogous genes originating from duplications preceding a given speciation event. Finally, pseudo paralogs are homologous genes that, in a single-genome analysis, appear as paralogs, but, they entered the genome through a combination of vertical inheritance and HGT. These terms describe various types of genetic relationships, each with its unique origin and characteristics. (1)

Precise identification of orthologous genes is crucial for many comparative genomics investigations and plays a significant role in annotating the functions of newly sequenced genomes. To find sets of orthologous genes, researchers commonly employ methods like analyzing phylogenetic trees, using heuristic algorithms based on sequence similarity, examining gene order conservation (synteny), or employing a combination of these techniques. In the case of tree-based methods, the direct approach often involves comparing an individual gene's evolutionary tree with a broader species-level tree. (2)
Tree-based methods for identifying orthologous genes use two models: one representing the evolutionary history of the genes (gene family tree) and another representing the organisms' evolution (species tree). These methods, known as tree reconciliation or tree mapping (3), compare these two models to figure out which genes are orthologs. The main idea is to find the simplest explanation for the evolutionary events, like gene duplications or losses. Once the gene tree is built, paralogs are genes that group closely with others from the same species, while orthologs group with genes from different species. This helps us understand the evolutionary relationships between genes.

In contrast to phylogenetic tree analysis, another approach assumes that genes or proteins considered orthologous should be more similar to each other than to any other genes or proteins from different organisms. This means that if you compare the sequences of orthologous genes, they should show more similarity to each other than to any other genes from the organisms being studied (4).
Pereira, C and their colleagues created a method that takes the outcomes of multiple orthologous gene prediction techniques and combines them to improve the results. This method has two main steps. First, it looks for common results among different prediction methods to form the starting point or "seeds" for groups of orthologous genes. Then, in the second step, it expands these seed groups using something called HMM profiles. The goal is to get more accurate and higher-quality predictions by considering overlapping information from various methods. (5)

However, existing methods for comparing these features have limitations, especially when dealing with information from different sources, and they struggle to handle overlapping or redundant feature data. To address this problem, in 2023, Dosch et al., developed a method called FAS (6), which combines information from various sources about protein features and organizes it into a structured graph. It then figures out the best ways to compare these feature patterns between different proteins. This approach helps resolve overlapping and redundant feature data more effectively. In tests involving thousands of pairs of proteins from humans and yeast, FAS consistently provides more accurate results compared to other methods that try to handle overlaps differently. FAS has practical applications, including improving the accuracy of software that assigns functions to proteins, finding differences in functions between similar proteins, and identifying mistakes in predictions about protein features. This new method, FAS, makes it easier to compare protein features and can be used in many areas of biology.
